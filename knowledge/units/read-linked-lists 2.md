We'll be working with C code that builds and manipulates *linked lists*.
You learned about linked lists in CS10, and may want to review the CS10 linked-list notes and implementation:

* slides in [pdf](media/cs10/cs10-lists.pdf) or [Powerpoint](media/cs10/cs10-lists.pptx)
* [SimpleList.java](media/cs10/SimpleList.java)
* [SinglyLinked.java](media/cs10/SinglyLinked.java)

You may want to review the material we discussed at the end of the last unit, and study the code for [sorter4.c](https://github.com/CS50Dartmouth21FS1/examples/blob/fall21s1/sorter4.c) and following.
