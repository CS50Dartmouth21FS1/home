The name "Terminal" is still commonly used in Unix parlance, right down to the MacOS app by that name.
This term refers to the fact that early Unix computers, like other computers of its time, had a small number of interactive 'terminals' connected to it -- each directly connected by a dedicated wire to a card within the computer.
Each terminal was little more than a keyboard and a screen - or in the early days, a keyboard and a printer that would print each character as it was typed, and print the characters sent by the computer.

The first such terminals were "teletypes", adapted from the device used by newsrooms around the country, which printed characters transmitted over the phone line from a distant device.
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-U-5ylvWo) shows a teletype in action.
Indeed, it is connected to a refurbished PDP8/e, which is the first computer I used in high school.
It ran 'ETOS' and was programmed in 'BASIC'.

From the sound of the teletype, can you tell why television news shows' opening music usually has a stocatto tap-tap-tap-tap-tap background theme?
