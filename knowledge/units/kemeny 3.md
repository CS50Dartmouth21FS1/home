John Kemeny was President of Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1981.
He was an accomplished mathematician (and assistant to Albert Einstein), an early computer scientist (co-inventing the [BASIC programming language](https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html)),
and (as president) brought co-education to Dartmouth.

He was also an excellent teacher and lecturer.
I encourage you to spend a half hour watching this 1984 recording in which he argues that computer programs always, necessarily, encode the values of those designing or implementing those programs.
This fundamental point is just as true today, as computer software increasingly controls our physical systems (cars, factories, weapons), our society (news, politics, social life), and our commerce (banking, advertising), and work life (hiring, training, and interacting).

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Kemeny) notes he "was a Hungarian-born American mathematician, computer scientist, and educator best known for co-developing the BASIC programming language in 1964 with Thomas E. Kurtz. Kemeny served as the 13th President of Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1981 and pioneered the use of computers in college education. Kemeny chaired the presidential commission that investigated the Three Mile Island accident in 1979."
