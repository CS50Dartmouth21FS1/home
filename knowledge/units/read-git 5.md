We recommend quickly scrolling through some of the [git resources](https://github.com/CS50Dartmouth21FS1/home/blob/main/logistics/systems.md#github) so you are familiar with where you might look for help when you are puzzled.
Some of the interactive tutorials are very helpful.
GitHub's own documentation is quite good.
