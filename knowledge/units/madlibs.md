Many of you may be familiar with the [Mad Libs](http://www.madlibs.com) books; each page is a game in which one player reads through a short story that contains fill-in blanks.
Each blank space is labeled with a part of speech, e.g., "noun", "verb", "adverb", and so forth.
The other players -- who cannot see the story -- respond with words, and the first player writes them in the corresponding blanks.
When all blanks are full, the first player reads the complete story.
The results are often amusing!

In [Activity 3](https://github.com/CS50Dartmouth21FS1/home/blob/fall21s1/activities/activity3) we look at [madlib.c](https://github.com/CS50Dartmouth21FS1/examples/blob/main/madlib.c).
Read the code and the questions posed in the activity, carefully, before you look at the 
[solution](https://github.com/CS50Dartmouth21FS1/home/blob/fall21s1/activities/activity3/solution.md).
It's worth studying!
