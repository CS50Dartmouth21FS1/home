Software design is both an art and a science, and there is a rich literature.

*The Pragmatic Programmer*, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas (2000, Addison Wesley) is a rich source of thoughtful maxims for software development: their ["tip list" is available on the web](https://pragprog.com/tips/).
We sprinkle some of their tips throughout the units.

The world is replete with lessons from *bad design:*

* [Boeing 737 Max](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/opinion/business-economics/boeing-737-max.html), in which certain aspects of the control system design caused several plane crashes.
* [Therac-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25), which had subtle bugs that caused several tragic deaths, is on many lists of the [worst computer bugs in history](https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/bug-day-race-condition-therac-25).
* Toyota - a speaker at the Thayer School once described how bad software design in their embedded systems lost them billions due to recalls and lawsuits; he described their software as *spaghetti code* with 11,000 global variables.
