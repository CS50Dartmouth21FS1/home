Unix pipes were invented by Doug McIlroy while he was working with Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs.
(As I mentioned earlier, Doug has been an adjunct professor here at Dartmouth College since his retirement several years ago.)
In this [two-page interview](media/history/DougMcIlroy.pdf), at the middle of the third column, Doug tells how pipes were invented and the `|` character selected as the operator.
Pay special attention to the next paragraph: the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (an operating system developed at Dartmouth) had something similar, even earlier!
