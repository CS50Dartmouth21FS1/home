# CS50 TSE Querier
## Requirements Spec

> In a requirements spec, **shall do** means **must do**.

The TSE Querier is a standalone program that reads the index file produced by the TSE Indexer, and page files produced by the TSE Querier, and answers search queries submitted via stdin.

The querier **shall**:

1. execute from a command line with usage syntax
   * `./querier pageDirectory indexFilename`
   * where `pageDirectory` is the pathname of a directory produced by the Crawler, and
   * where `indexFilename` is the pathname of a file produced by the Indexer.

1. validate it received exactly two command-line arguments and that 
	* `pageDirectory` is the pathname for a directory produced by the Crawler, and
	* `indexFilename` is the pathname of a file that can be read;

1. load the index from `indexFilename` into an internal data structure.

1. read search queries from stdin, one per line, until EOF.

	2. clean and parse each query according to the *syntax* described below.
	2. if the query syntax is somehow invalid, print an error message, do not perform the query, and prompt for the next query.
	2. print the 'clean' query for user to see.
	2. use the index to identify the set of documents that *satisfy* the query, as described below.
	2. if the query is empty (no words), print nothing.
	2. if no documents satisfy the query, print `No documents match.`
	2. otherwise, rank the resulting set of documents according to its *score*, as described below, and print the set of documents in decreasing rank order; for each, list the score, document ID and URL.
(Obtain the URL by reading the first line of the relevant document file from the `pageDirectory`.)

1. output nothing to stdout other than what is indicated above

1. exit zero when EOF is reached on stdin; exit with an error message to stderr and non-zero exit status on encountering an unrecoverable error, including
	* out of memory,
	* invalid command-line arguments,
	* unable to read a file named `pageDirectory/.crawler`,
	* unable to read a file named `pageDirectory/1`
	* unable to read a file named `indexFilename`

The querier *may assume* that

* `pageDirectory` has files named 1, 2, 3, ..., without gaps.
* The content of files in `pageDirectory` follow the format as defined in the specs; thus your code (to read the files) need not have extensive error checking.
* The content of the file named by `indexFilename` follows our index file format (as defined in Lab 5); thus your code (to recreate an index structure by reading a file) need not have extensive error checking.
* The provided index file corresponds to the provided `pageDirectory`, that is, was built by indexer from the files in that directory.

## Queries

The specs above indicate that you read one query per line, parse the query according to its *syntax*, determine which documents *satisfy* the query, and determine *score* for each document satisfying the query.
We define each term below.

### Syntax

A *query* is a sequence of words, with optional boolean operators ('and', 'or'), where 'and' has higher precedence than 'or'.

A *space* is any character for which `isspace()` returns true.
*Spaces* is a sequence of one or more space characters.

First, we ignore blank lines (i.e., empty or nothing but spaces).

Second, we translate all upper-case letters on the input line into lower-case.

Then, we use [Backus-Naur Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backusâ€“Naur_Form) for describing the query syntax; if you have not heard of BNF before, you're sure to see it in future CS classes (or software specs!).

```
query       ::= <andsequence> [or <andsequence>]...
andsequence ::= <word> [ [and] <word>]...
```
and `word` is a sequence of one or more (lower-case) letters; words are separated by spaces.

Think of the query as a sequence of *tokens*, each a `word` or a literal ('and', 'or'), with spaces between tokens, and optional spaces at the beginning or end of the line.
Note, too, that the literal 'and' may be left out and is thus implicit.

Notice how the structure of the syntax indicates that 'and' has higher precedence (binds more tightly) than 'or'.
A query is an OR'd sequence of AND-sequences, or for those of you familiar with logic, a *disjunction* of *conjunctions*.

> See the [unit](https://github.com/CS50Dartmouth21FS1/home/blob/fall21s1/knowledge/units/querier-expressions.md) noting how this syntax is similar to another grammar you know well: arithmetic.
>
>```
>expression ::= <product> [ + <product>]...
>product  ::= <number> [ * <number>]...
>```
> and `number` is a sequence of one or more digits.
> In an equation like `4 + 5 * 6`, the answer is `4 + (5 * 6) = 34`, not `(4 + 5) * 6 = 54`, because `*` has higher precedence than `+`.


Single-word examples (all equivalent):

```
 Dartmouth
 dartmouth
     dartmouth
```

Two-word examples (all equivalent):

```
 Dartmouth College
 dartmouth college
 dartmouth and college
    dartmouth    AND    College
```

The following two examples are different:

```
Dartmouth College AND computer science
Dartmouth College or computer science
```

There is an implicit 'and' between 'Dartmouth' and 'College' and between 'computer' and 'science'.
(Capitalization does not matter.) Thus, the above two queries are equivalent to

```
Dartmouth AND College AND computer AND science
Dartmouth AND College or computer AND science
```

The first is a single `andsequence` (a single conjunction); the second is a combination of a first `andsequence` and a second `andsequence` - that is, a disjunction of two conjunctions.

You can combine words more richly, of course:

```
Dartmouth or computer science or programming or Unix or Doug McIlroy
```

The following queries all have syntax errors:

```
and
or
and earth
or earth
planet earth or
planet earth and
planet earth and or science
planet earth and and science
planet earth or and science
Warning!
(The Lunar Chronicles #4.5)
```

because (per the syntax)

 * the literal 'and' must come between `words`, and the literal 'or' must come between `andsequences`, so they cannot appear at the beginning or end of a query,
 * the literals ('and' & 'or') cannot be adjacent
 * characters other than letters or spaces are disallowed.

Example output from the querier for some of the queries above, on a depth-3 index of the 'toscrape' section of our testing site:

```
Query: and 
Error: 'and' cannot be first
Query: or 
Error: 'or' cannot be first
Query: and earth 
Error: 'and' cannot be first
Query: or earth 
Error: 'or' cannot be first
Query: planet earth or 
Error: 'or' cannot be last
Query: planet earth and 
Error: 'and' cannot be last
Query: planet earth and or science 
Error: 'and' and 'or' cannot be adjacent
Query: planet earth and and science 
Error: 'and' and 'and' cannot be adjacent
Query: planet earth or and science 
Error: 'or' and 'and' cannot be adjacent
Error: bad character '!' in query.
Error: bad character '(' in query.
```

### Satisfy

A document *satisfies* a single-word query for `word` if the index indicates that `word` appears in that document.

A document *satisfies* a conjunction (aka andsequence) `wordA and wordB` if the index indicates that both `wordA` and `wordB` appear in the document.
By induction, a document satisfies `<andsequence> and wordC` if the document satisfies the `andsequence` and `wordC` also appears in the document.

A document *satisfies* a disjunction `wordA or wordB` if the index indicates that either `wordA` and `wordB` appear in the document.
By induction, a document satisfies `<andsequenceA> or <andsequenceB>` if the document satisfies the `andsequenceB` or satisfies `andsequenceB`, or both.

> Notice that 1-letter and 2-letter words never appear in the index, given the specs for the Indexer.
> Thus, no documents satisfy a single-word query if that word has fewer than 3 letters.
> For simplicity, your solution need not treat 1- or 2-letter words in any special way; queries like "a Dartmouth student" will always return an empty set.

### Score

Because we want to rank the documents satisfying the query, we need to score each document by *how well* it satisfies the document.

The score for a document satisfying a single-word query for `word` is the number of occurrences of `word` in that document.
(Fortunately, that's what your index tells you.)

The score for a document satisfying a conjunction (aka `andsequence`) `wordA and wordB` is the *minimum* of the score for `wordA` and the score for `wordB` on this document.
By induction, the score for a document satisfying `<andsequence> and wordC` is the minimum of the score for the `andsequence` and the score for `wordC` on this document.

The score for a document satisfying a disjunction `wordA or wordB` is the *sum* of the score for `wordA` and the score for `wordB` on this document (even if `wordA == wordB`).
By induction, the score for a document satisfying `<andsequenceA> or <andsequenceB>` is the sum of the score for `andsequenceA` and the score for `andsequenceB` on this document.

For example, consider three documents (D1, D2, D3) and three queries:

|query             | D1                  | D2                   | D3                  |
|:-----------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|:--------------------|
*matches*          | 0 cat, 5 dog, 7 emu | 3 cat, 2 dog, 1 emu  | 3 cat, 4 dog, 0 emu |
cat and dog        | score = 0           | score = 2            | score = 3*          |
cat or  dog        | score = 5           | score = 5            | score = 7*          |
dog or  dog        | score = 10*         | score = 4            | score = 8           |
cat and dog or emu | score = 7*          | score = 3            | score = 3           |

where * indicates the highest rank for each query.
