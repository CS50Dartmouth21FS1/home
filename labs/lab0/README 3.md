# Lab 0 - Setup

This first assignment is simple but essential.
It's not graded, but is **required** for you to participate in the course.

## Part 0: Meet the prof! (10 minutes)

<!-- @CHANGEME link -->

I want to meet you all!
[Sign up](https://calendly.com/david-kotz/get-to-know-you) (**now**) on Calendly for a slot to meet me (later this week).
This is just a quick 10-minute chance to introduce yourself... I also hope to talk with many of you often in office hours throughout the term.


## Part 1: Team Formation (5 minutes)

Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/49179) and click *Team Formation* link on the left side.
Answer its questions **by midnight EDT tomorrow** ([Instructions](https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=128042)).
It should take you less than five minutes.

This form provides us with the information we need
to form learning groups (project teams),
to learn more about your background, 
and to help support you through the term.

## Part 2: Slack (10 minutes)
Complete this step **before the next class meeting**.

Join our Slack Workspace via the button on [Canvas](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/49179).
This should only take a few minutes.
You'll automatically be part of several discussion channels,
and you can optionally join more by clicking *Add channels*, then *Browse all channels* below the list of channels.

All official course communications will come through Slack and Canvas.

## Part 3: Systems (20 minutes)
Complete this step **before the next class meeting**.

Read through the [Systems](https://github.com/CS50Dartmouth21FS1/home/blob/main/logistics/systems.md) page.
Most of you use MacOS or Windows -- not Linux -- but in this course we will program exclusively on Linux.
For consistency, we will all use a Linux server managed by our colleagues in the Thayer School of Engineering.
This machine is known as `plank.thayer.dartmouth.edu`.
Follow the instructions in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cs50spring2021/cs50-dev) to get yourself ready.
